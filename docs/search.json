    "text": "Introduction\nThe data science body of knowledge (DSBOK) may be divided into five broad areas: analytics, systems, design, value, and practice.\nThese areas are elements of an invariant model derived from the image of the pipeline that dominates discourse about the definition of data science. For a theoretical justification and more complete description of this model, see (Alvarado 2022).\nFor purposes of this essay, it is helpful to recall that the data science pipeline may be thought of as an arc, in which the pre- and post-processing segments mirror each other and combine to form structural areas.\nAmong these areas, the least well understood is design.\nTo understand design on its own terms, consider the communicative relationship between humans and machines and how this relationship maps onto the pipeline of data science. On the pre-processing side, the work of data science is focused on converting information as captured and understood by humans — for example, in textual or analog form — into forms that can be processed by machines. We call machine processable information data. On the post-processing side, data science is focused on converting the results of esoteric modeling and analysis into humanly intelligible forms through the work of visualization and digital storytelling.\nAbstractly, we may represent these moments as \\(H \\rightarrow M\\) and \\(M \\rightarrow H\\). The following table describes some of the concepts and practices currently associated with each:\nHuman-computer interaction"

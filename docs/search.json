    "text": "Introduction\nThe data science body of knowledge (DSBOK) may be divided into five broad areas: analytics, systems, design, value, and practice. The table below gives a sample of activities associated with each area.\nThese areas are elements of an invariant model derived from the image of the pipeline that has dominated discourse about the definition of data science for decades. For a theoretical justification and brief historical overview of this model, see (Alvarado 2022). For purposes of this essay, it is helpful to recall that the data science pipeline may be thought of as an arc, in which the pre- and post-processing segments mirror each other and combine to form structural areas (see appendix.html).\nAmong the areas of data science, the least well understood is design. This area encompasses the knowledge shared by both data modeling (which belongs to the pre-processing segment of the pipeline) and visualization (which belongs to the post-processing segment). Design is most closely associated with the field of human-computer interaction (HCI), but also the fields data modeling and ontology design, which tend to be associated with with database management, which belongs to systems. Because of these disparate associations, design tends not to be recognized as a separate field.\nTo understand design on its own terms, consider the communicative relationship between humans and machines and how this relationship maps onto the pipeline of data science. On the pre-processing side, the work of data science is focused on converting information as captured and understood by humans — for example, in textual or analog form — into forms that can be processed by machines. (We call machine processable information data.) On the post-processing side, data science is focused on converting the results of esoteric modeling and analysis into more humanly intelligible forms through the work of visualization and digital storytelling.\nFormally, we may represent these moments as \\(H \\rightarrow M\\) and \\(M \\rightarrow H\\) (or \\(H \\leftarrow M\\)). The following table describes some of the artifacts and practices currently associated with each:\nWhat is common to these activities? In both cases, the knowledge worker develops and applies a formal language, verbal or visual, to create a functional representation. These representations are of two kinds. The first kind are representations of the world to the data scientists and the computational and mathematical machinery that will process the represented information. The second kind are representations of the results of mathematical modeling and discovery to the world, i.e. to non-specialist stakeholders and to users of data products.\nHuman-computer interaction"

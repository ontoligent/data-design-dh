# Introduction

The data science body of knowledge ([DSBOK]{.acronym}) may be divided into five broad areas: [analytics]{.keyword}, [systems]{.keyword}, [design]{.keyword}, [value]{.keyword}, and [practice]{.keyword}. The table below gives a sample of activities associated with each area.

+---------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| AREA          | ACTIVITY                                                                                         |
+===============+==================================================================================================+
| **Analytics** | Statistical modeling, algorithmic modeling, simulations, pattern discovery, data reduction, etc. |
+---------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Systems**   | Programming, software development, ML ops, cloud computing, high-performance computing, etc.     |
+---------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Design**    | Data modeling, ontology making, visualization, data storytelling, etc.                           |
+---------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Value**     | Ethics, scientific research formulation, business value framing, strategic planning, etc.        |
+---------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Practice**  | Project management, cross-functional team building, connection to domain knowledge, etc.         |

: The Five Areas of Data Science

These areas are elements of an invariant model derived from the image of the *pipeline* that has dominated discourse about the definition of data science for decades. For a theoretical justification and brief historical overview of this model, see [@alvarado2022]. For purposes of this essay, it is helpful to recall that the data science pipeline may be thought of as an *arc*, in which the pre- and post-processing segments mirror each other and combine to form structural areas.

# Design

Among the areas of data science, the least well understood is [design]{.keyword}. This area encompasses the knowledge shared by both data modeling (which belongs to the pre-processing segment of the pipeline) and visualization (which belongs to the post-processing segment). Design is most closely associated with the field of human-computer interaction ([HCI]{style="acronym"}), but also the fields data modeling and ontology design, which tend to be associated with with database management, which belongs to [systems]{.keyword}. Because of these disparate associations, design tends not to be recognized as a separate field.

To understand design on its own terms, consider the communicative relationship between humans and machines and how this relationship maps onto the pipeline of data science. On the pre-processing side, the work of data science is focused on converting information as captured and understood by humans --- for example, in textual or analog form --- into forms that can be processed by machines. (We call machine processable information *data*.) On the post-processing side, data science is focused on converting the results of esoteric modeling and analysis into more humanly intelligible forms through the work of visualization and digital storytelling.

Formally, we may represent these moments as $H \rightarrow M$ and $M \rightarrow H$. The following table describes some of the concepts and practices currently associated with each:

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Pre-processing: $H \rightarrow M$                                                                               | Post-processing: $M \rightarrow H$                                                                                              |
+=================================================================================================================+=================================================================================================================================+
| [Visual modeling]{.underline}: E-R diagrams, UML (more generally), etc.                                         | [Interactive visualization]{.underline}: Dashboards, user-facing databases, etc.                                                |

| [Verbal classification]{.underline}: taxonomies and ontologies (RDF, SKOS, OWL), Knowledge Representation, etc. | [Static visualization]{.underline}: infographics, posters, embedded figures and charts, etc.                                    |
|                                                                                                                 |                                                                                                                                 |
| [Domain-specific models]{.underline}: vector space representations, protein models, text models, etc.           | [\                                                                                                                              |
|                                                                                                                 | Digital storytelling]{.underline}: integration of visual and verbal elements into narrative, cinematic, or immersive form, etc. |
